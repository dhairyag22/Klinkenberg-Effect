## Klinkenberg Effect
The Klinkenberg Effect describes how gas permeability in porous media is higher than liquid permeability due to gas slippage at pore walls. This occurs because gas molecules, unlike liquids, do not adhere perfectly to the surface, leading to an apparent increase in flow.
The gas and liquid permeability follow the relationship:
        Kg = Kl + c(1/Pm)
where,
    c = b*Kl
Therefore,
            Kg = Kl + b*Kl(1/Pm)
